## Bulding **ddcui**

## Requirements
- **ddcui** 0.4.0 requires version 2.0.0 of ddcutil or later.  Conversely, versions of **ddcui** prior to 0.4.0 will fail to
build with **ddcutil** version 2.0.0 or later. If **ddcutil** is installed from pre-built packages, 
the shared library and development packages must be installed as well as the main ddcutil package. 
- A recent version of QT 5.  **ddcui** will not build with versions of Qt older than 5.5. 
Unless you want to modify the the dialog boxes, or prefer the Qt Creator IDE, Qt Creator is not required. 


## Building Using CMake

**ddcui** can be built using CMake.  

- A CMake control file (***CMakeLists.txt***) is provided.
- To create the Makefile, change to the directory in which you wish to 
  build **ddcui** and issue the command: 
~~~
   cmake <directory containing CMakeLists.txt> 
~~~  
- Using the -S and -B options can ensure that the proper directory is used for the build tree. 
See the cmake man page for detais.

Erasing file CMakeCache.txt and directory CMakeFiles from the build directory befure running cmake can avoid perplexing errors
due to saved state.  This has a negligable effect on cmake performance.


## Building Using qmake

qmake is no longer supported.

<!--
- A qmake control file (***ddcui.pro***) is provided.
- To create the Makefile, change to the directory in which you wish to 
  build **ddcui** and issue one of the commands: 
~~~
  qmake -qt=qt5 <directory containing ddcui.pro>/ddcui.pro
  qtchooser -qt=5 -run-tool=qmake <directory containing ddcui.pro>/ddcui.pro
~~~

Note: The command **make install** using the makefile generated by **qmake** always installs files under directory /usr/local. 
If you need to change the installation prefix, use **Cmake**.

<!--
## Using QtCreator

User arupda has written up [notes](https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcui/issues/1) on building **ddcui** using QtCreator and CMake.
Note that arupda has modified the source to build with an earlier version of Qt. 
-->

## Issues: 
- If ddcutil is installed from the tarball using command ***make install***, the
PKGCONFIG file ddcutil.pc is installed in a subdirectory of /usr/local.  Depending on Linux distribution, 
this subdirectory may or may not be in the default PKGCONFIG search path.  For example, on Ubuntu it is in the 
search path, but on Fedora it is not.  To add the relevant path, issue the command: 
~~~
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/share/pkgconfig
~~~
before running ***qmake*** or ***cmake***. 

To see the default PKGCONFIG search path, issue the command:
~~~
pkg-config --variable pc_path pkg-config
~~~

Generally speaking, if the ddcutil library and development files are installed under directory /usr instead of /usr/local
tool path adjustments (often distribution specific) will be unnecessary.  This will be the case if the files are installed
from an rpm or dpkg package, or (if building ddcutil from source), ".configure" is run with argument "--prefix=/usr".
